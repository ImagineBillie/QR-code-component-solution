## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Responsive design principles

### What I Learned
1. **Planning Layout**: Sketching the component structure before coding helped me map out the HTML elements and CSS flex containers.
2. **Responsive Practices**: Implementing percentage-based widths and using `max-width` allowed the component to adapt across screen sizes.
3. **Flexbox Centering**: I practiced centering techniques, including `margin: auto` and parent flex containers with `justify-content` and `align-items`.

This challenge reinforced my frontend fundamentals and gave me confidence in my project setup routine.

### Continued Development

I plan to explore advanced CSS features like CSS Grid and custom properties to further enhance layout flexibility.
